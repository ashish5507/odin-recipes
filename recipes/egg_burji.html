        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Egg bhurji, also known as Anda Bhurji or Ande ka Khagina, is a scrambled eggs dish which is a popular street food and a breakfast, lunch or dinner recipe. Originating from the Indian subcontinent, it is sometimes compared with the Parsi dish akuri.</p>
        <p>Bhurji means scramble, so Egg or Anda Bhurji is just scrambled eggs flavored with aromatics and spices.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Cilantro</li>
            <li>Neutal oil</li>
            <li>Garlic cloves</li>
            <li>Red chilli powder</li>
            <li>Yellow onion</li>
            <li>Ground spices like Coriander powder, Cumin powder
            </li>
            <li>Vine or Roma tomato</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Crack the eggs and whisk to combine. Adding cilantro and salt here helps evenly distribute them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a nonstick pan. Sauté the onions to soften and bring out their natural sweetness. A bit of crisp around the edges is lovely, but we’re not browning them like we would for a curry.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add garlic and green chili pepper to take the bite out and soften. I also add the remaining salt here to add flavor to the plentiful onions. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce the heat and cook out the rawness (or kachapan) from spices. Add the tomato and sauté for a minute to soften but still keep its freshness.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now you’ll pour in the eggs. Stir the eggs constantly, just until they’re cooked and no longer custardy or slimy.
            </li>
        </ol>
