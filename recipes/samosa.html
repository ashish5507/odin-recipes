        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A samosa is a popular fried pastry, originating in India, and often enjoyed as a snack or appetizer.</p>
        <p>It's known for its triangular shape, crispy outer layer made from flour, and flavorful filling. The filling typically consists of a mixture of spiced potatoes and peas, but can also include other vegetables, meat, or even cheese, depending on the region and preference. 
</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>all purpose flour</li>
            <li>oil/ghee</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>potatoes</li>
            <li>chillies</li>
            <li>onions</li>
            <li>garam masala</li>
            <li>chilli powder</li>
            <li>tumeric powder</li>
            <li>green peas</li>
            <li>cumin seeds</li>
            <li>ginger</li>
            <li>raisins (optional for filling)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, add all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, and a few tablespoons of oil or ghee. The fat is what gives the crust its flaky texture.</li>
            <li>now, we are gonna use this dough to create samosa outer layering which we are gonna deep fry after filling it up</li>
            <li>Rub the oil into the flour using your fingers. The texture should feel a little crumbly and sandy.</li>
            <li>Slowly add water, a little at a time, and knead the mixture into a firm but pliable dough. It should not be soft or sticky. The firmer the dough, the crispier the samosa will be.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes while you prepare the filling.</li>
            <li>Peel and mash the boiled potatoes into small chunks—not too smooth. This gives the filling texture.</li>
            <li>In a pan, heat a tablespoon of oil and add a pinch of cumin seeds. Let them crackle.</li>
            <li>Add the mashed potatoes and green peas to the pan, along with a sprinkle of salt, chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala. You can also add a pinch of dry mango powder (amchur) or a squeeze of lemon juice for tang.</li>
            <li>Stir everything together well and cook for 2–3 minutes so the flavors mix evenly. Taste and adjust the seasoning.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool to room temperature before filling the samosas.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Shape the samosas</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide the dough into equal portions and roll each one into a smooth ball.</li>
            <li>Roll each ball into a thin oval or circle, about 6 inches across. Use a rolling pin and a little flour to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Cut the rolled-out dough in half to form two semi-circles.</li>
            <li>Take one half and shape it into a cone by folding the straight edge inward and sealing it with a touch of water. Press the edges firmly so it holds.</li>
            <li>Fill the cone with a few spoonfuls of the potato mixture. Be careful not to overfill.</li>
            <li>Moisten the open edge with water and press it together to seal the top. Make sure it's completely sealed to prevent it from bursting while frying.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Fry the samosas</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan on medium-low heat. If the oil is too hot, the outside will brown too quickly and the inside may stay uncooked.</li>
            <li>Carefully place the samosas into the oil, a few at a time. Do not overcrowd the pan.</li>
            <li>Fry gently, turning occasionally, until all sides are evenly golden brown. This may take 8–10 minutes per batch.</li>
            <li>Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels to absorb excess oil.</li>
        </ol>
